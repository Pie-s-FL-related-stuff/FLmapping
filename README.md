# Mapping
This repo aims to provide an easy way to build the full minimaps for Fantasy Life (3DS), and convert full maps back to tiles with the right names to be used in a Citra texture pack.

### "Missing" tiles
Some tiles could not be recovered through Citra texture dumps because you just can't get close enough to load them. I got them thanks to @zXd12, using a mix of [ninfs](https://github.com/ihaveamac/ninfs), [3ds-xfsatool](https://github.com/mhvuze/3ds-xfsatool) and [ztexbatchconverter](https://github.com/mdstiller/ztexbatchconverter).
It won't be an issue if you want to make custom textures for Citra though, as you just can't see them (except if you find an OOB i'm not aware of lol).
